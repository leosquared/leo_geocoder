This *Flask* app allows the user to upload a CSV file with addresses and other data points to the server. The server then parses through the addresses and uses two different APIs to generate and return geocodes. 

This is currently hosted [here](https://enigmatic-atoll-4549.herokuapp.com/). Any request that takes longer than 30 seconds will time out. 

Still in development.
